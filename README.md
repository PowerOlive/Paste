### Paste

---

Paste is a android application which was developed by me when i was in Senior 3. Paste aimed to solve a major problem for android users ---- The clipboard limitation. Without Paste, it will be impossible to recopy a content you once copied weeks ago. Meanwhile, Paste does something more. By using android accessibility service, users can copy any content in any position on screen. By using AI technology, Paste can customize operation based on what you have copied.
